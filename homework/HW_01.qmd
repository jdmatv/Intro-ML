__Question 1:__ Let $X$ be a Uniform(0, 1) random variable and let $Y = X^3 + X^2 + X$. Write a function that estimates the mean and variance of $Y$ using Monte Carlo simulation.
Your function should take as input the number of simulations to run and return the estimated mean and variance of $Y$.

```{julia}
using Statistics

# define y function
function y_func(x::Float64)
    return x^3 + x^2 + x
end 

# define monte carlo function
function monte_carlo_x(trials::Int)
    results = [y_func(rand(Float64)) for _ in 1:trials]
    return mean(results), var(results)
end
```

__Question 2:__ Test the function above with 10,000 simulations. What are the estimated mean and variance of $Y$?

```{julia}
# run 10,000 trials
mc_mean, mc_var = monte_carlo_x(10000)
output = """
Mean = $(round(mc_mean, digits=2))
Variance = $(round(mc_var, digits=2))
"""
print(output)
```

__Question 3:__ Time how long it takes to run the function above with 10,000; 100,000; 1,000,000; and 10,000,000 simulations. Display a table or data frame with columns corresponding to the number of simulations, the time it took to run them (in seconds), and the number of simulations per second.

```{julia}
using DataFrames

# define function to measure run time
function runtime(trials::Int)
    result, time = @timed begin
        monte_carlo_x(trials)
    end
    return time
end

# four sim sizes
sim_sizes = [10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000]

# run simulation for each size
sim_runtimes = [runtime(x) for x in sim_sizes]

# creating dataframe
sim_df = DataFrame(simulations = sim_sizes, runtime = sim_runtimes)
sim_df.sim_per_sec = sim_df.simulations ./ sim_df.runtime
print(sim_df)
```

__LLM Use:__ I used RANDChat throughout this assignment to familiarize myself with Julia syntax, install packages, and resolve code errors. I used the latest GPT-4 model available with the default system prompt: "You are an AI at RAND. You are scholarly and unbiased. Follow the user's instructions carefully. Respond using markdown." I asked the system the following prompts:

* 'how to sample random variable in julia'
* 'simple monte carlo in julia'
* 'why _ as iterator'
* 'is this used in other languages'
* 'best practice for creating an array with for loop in julia'
* 'mean and variance in julia'
* 'Warning: The project dependencies or compat requirements have changed since the manifest was last resolved...'
* 'f string in julia'
* 'rounding in julia / what does %.2f mean'
* 'printing strings in julia with line breaks'
* 'why println vs. print'
* 'dataframe in julia'
* 'time run time in julia'
* '\@time output variable'
* 'divide first element of array by first element of other array, then second, etc.'
* 'dataframe mutate divide one column by another column'
* 'ERROR: The following package names could not be resolved:...'
* 'bulleted list in quarto/markdown'
